## Create basic React app

Follow [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to create a basic React app. Look at structure of directories and files to see how it all fits together.

## Try D3 in basic React App

Follow [How to get started with D3 and React - freecodecamp - 13 May 2019](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-started-with-d3-and-react-c7da74a5bd9f/). Hmm, I don't understand where to put the d3 code in App.js

Follow [Interactive Applications with React & D3, Elijah Meeks, 4 May 2017](https://medium.com/@Elijah_Meeks/interactive-applications-with-react-d3-f76f7b3ebc71).

- First try the approach in the section `Traditional D3 rendering with React`.
- It works!
- I'll have to try the approach in section `React for element creation, D3 as the visualization kernel` later as I've run out of time.
